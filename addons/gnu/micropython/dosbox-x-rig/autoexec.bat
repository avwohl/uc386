rem DOSBox-X autoexec for the MicroPython network test rig.
rem
rem Loads the Crynwr ne2000 packet driver at INT 0x60 (matches
rem pktdrv_uc386dos.c's IVT scan target), then runs MP.EXE under
rem the bundled DOS extender. SLIRP's DHCP server hands out
rem 10.0.2.15, same lease the dos_emu sim does, so the
rem MicroPython REPL's DHCP probe should succeed identically in
rem both environments.
rem
rem All output is teed into RIG.LOG so run.sh can read it after
rem DOSBox-X exits in -silent mode.

rem ECHOTEST.EXE is a minimal printf-only smoke (built from

rem AH=40 passthrough reaches RIG.LOG" before we try MP.EXE.
rem If this baseline doesn't print, the issue is the rig itself
rem (DOSBox-X config, autoexec redirect, PMODE/W bridge); if it
rem does print, MP.EXE-specific runtime is the next thing to dig.

rem Append MP.EXE's stdout directly to RIG.LOG so its output is
rem visible even when MP.EXE hangs and dosbox-x gets SIGKILLed
rem before the autoexec can run a `type` step. The previous
rem "MP.EXE > MP_OUT.TXT; type MP_OUT.TXT >> RIG.LOG" pattern
rem hid all of MP's output when the timeout fired (which is
rem exactly the case we need diagnostics for). The trade-off is
rem that the "after-mp marker" line appears only when MP.EXE
rem actually returns; if it doesn't, RIG.LOG ends with whatever
rem bytes MP printed last before the kill.

rem Extender comparison: if MP_DOS4G.EXE is present, run it under
rem dos4g (different INT 21h reflector). MP.EXE under PMODE/W
rem hangs at _main → _write; if MP_DOS4G.EXE prints
rem "[mp-main-entered]" the bug is PMODE/W-specific. Otherwise the
rem bug lives in something earlier (maybe in our codegen-emitted
rem _write or in DOSBox-X itself).
